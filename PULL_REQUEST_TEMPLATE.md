Performance improvements:
- Added database connection pooling (20 connections)
- Added response compression middleware
- Added static asset caching headers
- Added database indexes for common queries
- Optimized MySQL table engines and charset

Testing:
- Added unit tests for authentication flow
- Added integration tests for API endpoints  
- Added security audit in CI pipeline
- Added performance benchmarking guidelines
- Achieved 70%+ test coverage on critical paths
